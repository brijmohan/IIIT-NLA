Digital TV is the only convergent technology without basic interoperability.
Regulatory measures will be required to promote interoperability between the networks and devices that will be used to access digital TV and interactive services.
Interoperability can be achieved through declaration and licensing of those key standards, interfaces and authoring tools necessary to reach the end user.
This will promote interoperability without undermining innovation.
Third parties will need access to this information at the same time as the gateway owners' own services.
