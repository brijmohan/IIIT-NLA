Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which has, at its heart, the issue of transport safety.
Indeed you responded in kind, as I knew you would do.
We need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now.
Mr President, I too agree that the convention that we are examining is but a small step - and still too small a step - towards the construction of the common area of freedom, security and justice which Europe will hopefully one day become.
So far, unfortunately, in Spain and France, just the opposite has been happening as regards the on-going conflict in the Basque country.
