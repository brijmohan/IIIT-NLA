Resumption of the session 
Madam President, on a point of order. 
This is an important matter. 
This is the case of Alexander Nikitin. 
I must admit that, at present, the matter seems to be somewhat confused. 
Then we shall follow the usual procedure, hearing one speaker in favour and one against. 
This issue is extremely topical. 
Thank you, Mr Sj√∂stedt who this question. 
We are a recognised minority? 
It is also a matter of conviction.
