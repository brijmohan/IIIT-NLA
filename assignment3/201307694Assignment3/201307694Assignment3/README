To initiate the program we need following inputs:

There should be a data folder present in the same directory as this program
1. A3 file genrated by GIZA++ (data/A3)
2. Language model (n-grams) file generated by SRILM (data/lm)
3. Input sentences, 10 sentences to be decoded (data/input)


To run the program we need to run "assignment3main.py", but this may 
consume lot of memory if decoding process is also included. So we can run it in two parts

first : assignment3main.py  - to generate phrase pairs and score them
second : test.py  - to decode 10 sentences using stack decoding

test.py picks the inputs from default locations and produce output sentences decoded using
stack decoding.


Current input and output files for 10 german sentences are in same folder (input / output). They are
obtained using 10,000 sentences corpus.
