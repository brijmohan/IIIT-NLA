To initiate the program we need following inputs:

There should be a data folder present in the same directory as this program
1. A3 file genrated by GIZA++ (data/A3)
2. Language model (n-grams) file (data/lm)
3. Input sentences (data/input)


To run the program we need to run "assignment3main.py", but this may 
consume lot of memory if decoding process is also included. So we can run it in two parts

first : assignment3main.py
second : test.py

test.py picks the inputs from default locations and produce output sentences decoded using
stack decoding.


Current input and output files for 10 german sentences are in same folder (input / output). They are
obtained using 10,000 sentences corpus.
